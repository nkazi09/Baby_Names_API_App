Every 10 years, the Social Security Administration provides data about the 1000 most popular boy and girl names for children born in the US for each gender, at http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ . Task is to display the baby names, popularity rankings, and meanings.

This program uses Ajax to fetch data from the Webster server. Ajax can only connect to a web server from a page located on that same server. This means that you must upload your page to Webster to test it. If you try to fetch data from Webster while viewing the page from your local hard drive, the request will fail with an exception.
